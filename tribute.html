            Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Prabhavati Bose (née Dutt) and Janakinath Bose on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack—in what is today the state of Odisha in India,
            but was then the Orissa Division of Bengal Province in British India. His mother , the anchor of family life, had her first child at age 14 and 13 children thereafter.
            Subhas was the ninth child and the sixth son. Jankinath, a successful lawyer and government pleader, was loyal to the government of British India and scrupulous about 
            matters of language and the law. A self-made man from the rural outskirts of Calcutta, he had remained in touch with his roots, returning annually to his village 
            during the pooja holidays.

            According to historian Gordon, "Gandhi, however, set Bose on to the leader of the Congress and Indian nationalism in Bengal, C. R. Das, and in him Bose found the leader whom he sought.
            Das launched Bose into nationalist politics. Bose would work within the ambit of the Indian National Congress politics for nearly 20 years even as he tried to change its course.
            He started the newspaper Swaraj and took charge of publicity for the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee.[93] His mentor was Chittaranjan Das who was a spokesman for aggressive nationalism 
            in Bengal. In the year 1923, Bose was elected the President of Indian Youth Congress and also the Secretary of Bengal State Congress. He was also the editor of the newspaper "Forward", founded
            by Chittaranjan Das.Bose worked as the CEO of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation for Das when the latter was elected mayor of Calcutta in 1924.During the same year, when he was leading a 
            protest march in Calcutta, he along with Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi and other leaders were arrested and put behind bars.[96] In a roundup of nationalists in 1925, Bose was arrested and sent to prison in Mandalay,
            where he contracted tuberculosis. In 1927, after being released from prison, Bose became general secretary of the Congress party and worked with Jawaharlal Nehru for independence. In late December 1928, 
            Bose organised the Annual Meeting of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta. His most memorable role was as General officer commanding (GOC) Congress Volunteer Corps.A little later, Bose was again 
            arrested and jailed for <strong>civil disobedience</strong>; this time he emerged to become Mayor of Calcutta in 1930.

            During the mid-1930s Bose travelled in Europe, visiting Indian students and European politicians, including Benito Mussolini. He observed party organisation and saw communism and fascism in action.In this period,
             he also researched and wrote the first part of his book The Indian Struggle, which covered the country's independence movement in the years 1920–1934. In 1938 Bose stated his opinion that the INC "should be organised 
             on the broadest anti-imperialist front with the two-fold objective of winning political freedom and the establishment of a socialist regime."By 1938 Bose had become a leader of national stature and agreed to accept nomination
              as Congress President. He stood for unqualified Swaraj (self-governance), including the use of force against the British. This meant a confrontation with Mohandas Gandhi, who in fact opposed Bose's presidency,splitting the Indian 
              National Congress party.In Germany, he was attached to the Special Bureau for India under Adam von Trott zu Solz which was responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio.He founded the Free India Center
               in Berlin, and created the Indian Legion (consisting of some 4500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa prior to their capture by Axis forces.

            In the consensus of scholarly opinion, Subhas Chandra Bose's death occurred from third-degree burns on 18 August 1945 after his overloaded Japanese plane crashed in
             Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan). However, many among his supporters, especially in Bengal, refused at the time, and have refused since, to believe either the 
             fact or the circumstances of his death. Conspiracy theories appeared within hours of his death and have thereafter had a long shelf life, keeping alive various martial 
             myths about Bose. In Taihoku, at around 2:30 pm as the bomber with Bose on board was leaving the standard path taken by aircraft during take-off, the passengers inside heard 
             a loud sound, similar to an engine backfiring.The mechanics on the tarmac saw something fall out of the plane. It was the portside engine, or a part of it, and the propeller.
             The plane swung wildly to the right and plummeted, crashing, breaking into two, and exploding into flames.Inside, the chief pilot, copilot and Lieutenant-General Tsunamasa Shidei, 
             the Vice Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, who was to have made the negotiations for Bose with the Soviet army in Manchuria, were instantly killed.Bose's assistant Habibur 
             Rahman was stunned, passing out briefly, and Bose, although conscious and not fatally hurt, was soaked in gasoline.When Rahman came to, he and Bose attempted to leave by the rear door,
             but found it blocked by the luggage.They then decided to run through the flames and exit from the front.

            Bose was featured on the stamps in India from 1964, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2016, 2018 and 2021.[156] Bose was also featured in ₹2 coins in 1996 and 1997, ₹75 coin in 2018 and ₹125 coin in 2021.
            Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport at Kolkata, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, formerly Ross Island and many other institutions in India are named after him. On 23 August 2007, 
            Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzō Abe visited the Netaji Bhawan in Kolkata.Abe, who is also the recipient of Netaji Award 2022,[162] said to Bose's family "The Japanese are deeply moved by Bose's strong 
            will to have led the Indian independence movement from British rule. Netaji is a much respected name in Japan."In 2021, the Government of India declared 23 January as Parakram Divas to commemorate the birth 
            anniversary of Subhas Chandra Bose. Political party, Trinamool Congress and the All India Forward Bloc demanded that the day should be observed as 'Deshprem Divas'.A holographic statue of Bose at the India Gate 
            to mark his 125th birth anniversary was installed at India Gate and a permanent granite statue replaced the holographic statue later.
